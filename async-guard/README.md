## CanDeactivate Guard Approaches: A Comparison

Angular CanDeactivate Guard Approaches: A Comparison
When implementing CanDeactivate guards in Angular, especially for handling unsaved changes, the architectural approach you choose significantly impacts your application's maintainability, scalability, and testability. This table compares two common patterns: Direct Component Access and utilizing a dedicated ChangeMonitorService.

| Feature | Approach 1 (Direct Component Access) | Approach 2 (ChangeMonitorService) | Approach 2 (ChangeMonitorService) |
| Cons | - Tight Coupling: The guard is directly dependent on the component's internal structure and methods.&lt;br>- Limited Scalability: Adding more components with unsaved changes means modifying the guard for each, leading to repetitive code.&lt;br>- Poor Extensibility: Difficult to introduce common or evolving monitoring logic without changing multiple components/guards.&lt;br>- Reduced Maintainability: Changes to the unsaved logic might require modifications in both components and the guard.&lt;br>- Less Reusable: The guard is specific to the component it directly accesses.&lt;br>- Difficult to Test: Testing the guard requires mocking the specific component instance.&lt;br>- Violates DRY Principle: Logic for handling unsaved changes might be duplicated across components or guards. | - Increased Complexity: Requires defining a separate service and a registration mechanism.&lt;br>- Initial Setup Overhead: More code to write initially compared to direct access. |
| When to Use | - Small, isolated applications: When you have a single, simple form and are certain it won't grow or need similar functionality elsewhere.&lt;br>- Proof-of-concept/Spike: For quick tests or demonstrating a basic concept where reusability and scalability are not immediate concerns. | - Enterprise or medium-to-large applications: When you expect to have multiple forms or components with unsaved changes.&lt;br>- Applications prioritizing maintainability and testability: When code quality, ease of updates, and robust testing are critical.&lt;br>- When consistent unsaved change logic is required: For a standardized approach across different parts of the application. |
